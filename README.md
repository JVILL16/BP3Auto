# BP3Auto

## What was the purpose of creating this automation?
The reasoning behind this project was to save a little bit of time and save input error when copying / pasting for a simple task and sending an email to Production. Also the extra time I had was used here lol; however, I also wanted to show how the functionality works, the process of making and downloading the setup for this program, and the future and updates of this progressivly intuitive automation. Below this blob of words is the download zip file for the automation and there will be updates to it as well.

## Downloading software and extensions
The setup for this is essentially downloading the python installation to run on your comamnd line but if anyone is interested in testing out the file, editing it, or even just having it, I'll still have it here to show.

1. Go to this website Python Installation and click on "Download Python 3.X.X" version

2. Through the installation process just click okay and use the recommended features if it ever asks. Once done with this then you are able to go to your command line and run python scripts with py or python3 commands.

3. Now download the different packages from python by running "py -m pip install pywin32 pandas numpy openpyxl" on the command prompt.

4. Also if you have downloaded the zip file on the left and set it to a path you would like to be, then good; if not then go ahead and download it put it somewhere on your "U" drive.

Now this part is only if you want to mess with the code, easier way to see the code and edit it but if you do not want to then that is okay just a reminder that you probably going to have to use the editpad to edit the code because later on in these steps, we have to change the file paths into your own file paths in the code.

Below you can download one of these IDE's or applications tp mess with the code. If you download one of these making sure within one of these applications you choose, make sure to download the extensions for them. If there is any questions, come by my desk, message me, or email me.

For Visual Studio Code ---> Visual Studio Code and click on "Download for Windows"

For Anaconda ---> Anaconda and click on "Download for Windows"

## Setting up the file paths and organization

Turns out you dont need to mess with any code since its a simple installation; all you have to do is save the ".exe" file on you Desktop or pin it on your start task bar.
